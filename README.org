Pabbrev provides predictive abbreviation expansion with no configuration needed.
It wors with any mode.

Pabbrev is a small package, which analyzes buffer text in the buffer and
collects usage statistics to rank most used words highest. Pabbrev is
un-intrusive and out of the way. It does not provide any user interface on its
own other than TAB-based insertion on demand. Pabbrev can be used with Emacs
completion facilities and packages such as Companry or Corfu, for the user
interaction and user interface.

For more details see pabbrev.el

* Features

- Timer-based auto-suggestions (does not block main user-interface)
- In-buffer color-coded display of best candidate
- Suggestions by usage frequency or shortest-prefix
- The current candidate is inserted with =TAB=
- List of all available suggestions

* Installation and Configuration

Pabbrev is available from [[https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/corfu.html][GNU ELPA]], and can be installed directly via
~package-install~. After installation, the global minor mode can be enabled with
=M-x global-pabbrev-mode=. In order to configure Pabbrev and other packages in
your init.el, you may want to use the built-in ~use-package~.

* Key bindings

Pabbrev bind keybindings in pabbrev-mode-map, and currently only binds
<TAB> key to pabbrev-exapnd-maybe function.
